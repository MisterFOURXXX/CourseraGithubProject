# Simple Interest Calculator

This Python script calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period (in years).

## Description

The script takes three inputs from the user:

* **Principal Amount:** The initial amount of money.
* **Annual Interest Rate:** The interest rate per year (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%).
* **Time (Years):** The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed (in years).
