# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexually suggestive language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual
  attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment of any kind
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting us at [your_email@example.com]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. We are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific
enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Community leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1,
